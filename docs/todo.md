### 🧠 moodScore Implementation (100%)

- [x] **Database Schema for `moodScore`**:
  - [x] Add `moodScore Int?` to `Reflection` model in `prisma/schema.prisma`.
  - [x] Generate and run migration (`bunx prisma migrate dev --name added_mood_score`).
- [x] **`moodScore` Generation Logic**:
  - [x] Update AI prompt in `reflection-service.ts` (via `ai-client.ts`) to request `moodScore` (1-100) from user's reflection.
  - [x] Modify AI response processing in `reflection-service.ts` to extract and save `moodScore`.
  - [x] Handle potential errors if `moodScore` is not returned or invalid.
- [x] **Command Integration**:
  - [x] `/reflect`: Ensure `moodScore` is saved with new reflection.
  - [x] `/stats`:
    - [x] Modify `analytics-service.ts` to calculate average `moodScore` and trend.
    - [x] Update `stats-command.ts` to display `moodScore` information.
  - [x] `/summary`: Display daily `moodScore`.
- [x] **Enhanced AI Context**:
  - [x] Modify AI interaction logic (e.g., in `ai-client.ts` or related services) to use weekly/monthly average `moodScore` for better AI understanding.
    - *Note: Average `moodScore` (weekly/monthly) is calculable via `AnalyticsService`. Decided against sending this to the current reflection AI prompt (which *generates* daily `moodScore`) to avoid circular reasoning. This average score is available for future, distinct AI interactions.*
- [x] **Testing**:
  - [x] Unit test `moodScore` extraction.
  - [x] Unit test `moodScore` analytics (average, trend).
  - [x] Test `moodScore` display in `/stats` and `/summary` (conceptual, core logic tested in services).
